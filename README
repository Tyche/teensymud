= TeensyMUD Server
= v2.4.0

---
== Introduction
TeensyMUD is a very simple mud server written in Ruby.  It uses a multiplexed single-threaded network driver using Acceptor/Reactor and Observer patterns and YAML formatted text files as a database.  It is also a pure event driven system where all game objects communicate with each other via events.  

This server was initially created in response to an Aprils Fool's joke posted by Erwin Andreasen on TheMudConnector forum announcing a 1K mud contest.  Those obfuscated versions can be found in the repository.

Does TeensyMUD have a future?  Who knows?  I don't.

== Download
The latest release can be found at ftp://sourcery.dyndns.org/pub/mud/teensymud or checked out of http://sourcery.dyndns.org/svn/teensymud/release

== System Dependencies
=== Required
[Ruby 1.8.2] Can be obtained at the home of Ruby, http://www.ruby-lang.org.  It runs on most platforms.

[RubyGems] To install rake and various things.  See - http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems
[Rake] To build documentation, run tests, etc.  See - http://rake.rubyforge.org
[Racc] To rebuild FARTS parser.  Ruby comes with Racc runtime so this is not needed for execution. See - http://i.loveruby.net/en/prog/racc.html
